We emulated the ext file system. As such we have many of the issues of that
file system which we covered in class. For example we have a bitmap of free
blocks which we use to track free blocks, this gets slow on big disks. We also
currently have our file system tied to the 1MB size, which is a problem.
Another issue present in our file system is that we allocate memory in 4k pages.
This is probably larger than we would truly prefer. If we were to work on this
project further we would have smaller blocks of memory and more than one direct
block per inode.

A few advantages of our filesystem is that we can use random blocks to compose 
a file, but it will also prefer sequential blocks when allocating files.

If we had more time I would also clean up the code. We wrote a fair amount of
utility functions which would have made writing the code easier in the
beginning.

We implemented all of the required features, no more, no less. If you count it
we added the ability to hard link, which wasn't written in the nufs.c starter
code, but it was tested for so I consider it required. So our definition of
required here is that it was stubbed in the starter code.
